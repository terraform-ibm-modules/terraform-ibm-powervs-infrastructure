# Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone - 'Quickstart OpenShift Variation'
{: #deploy-arch-ibm-pvs-inf-standard-openshift}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-industry="Technology"}
{: toc-use-case="ITServiceManagement"}
{: toc-version="v10.0.1"}

The Quickstart OpenShift deployment on Power Virtual Server with a VPC landing zone uses the Red Hat IPI installer to set up an OpenShift cluster. Before the deployment begins, it provisions VPC services and creates a Power Virtual Server workspace, which together form the landing zone used to access and manage the cluster.

The number of PowerVS master and worker nodes and their respective compute configurations can be configured during deployment. Optionally, Monitoring and Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection can also be configured.

Due to technical limitations, the cost estimate Projects gives does not include the PowerVS resources deployed. The cost estimate given on the catalog page is accurate for a deployment using default values. This only applies to the Quickstart OpenShift variation.

IBM Cloud® Power Virtual Servers (PowerVS) is a public cloud offering that an enterprise can use to establish its own private IBM Power computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure. PowerVS is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants and infrastructure components, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud. This deployable architecture provides a framework to build a PowerVS offering according to the best practices and requirements from the IBM Cloud.

## OpenShift Components
{: #standard-openshift-openshift-components}

Once the landing zone components are deployed, this architecture leverages the [RedHat IPI installer](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/installing_on_ibm_power_virtual_server/index){: external} to create an OpenShift cluster.

| Requirement | Component | Choice | Alternative choice |
|-------------|-----------|--------|--------------------|
|* Deploy PowerVS instances for Bootstrap (temporary), Master, and Worker nodes. | PowerVS instances | The customer can specify the number of master and worker nodes and customize their compute profiles. |
|* Modify the DNS Service instance to correctly resolve the cluster API | DNS Service instance | Add CNAME entries to DNS zone to resolve internal and external cluster APIs. Only support .test, .example, .invalid domains to prevent public resolution. |
|* Application Load Balancers to establish connectivity to the cluster API. | Three Application Load Balancers | One for internal API, one for external api, and one for the applications deployed in the cluster. |
|* Use DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses to the nodes | DHCP Subnet in PowerVS | Machine network dynamically assigns IP addresses to the nodes. |
|* Modify security groups to allow network traffic to API. | Default Security Group | The default security group is attached to the load balancers and configured so the required network traffic is able to pass. |
